/**
 * trustshare API
 *
 * Welcome to the trustshare API Reference documentation. Here you can find detailed information about the endpoints we provide as well as the shape of entities within the system.  # Getting Started It only takes a few minutes to begin using our __Sandbox__ environment straight away. Let's begin... 1. __Create an Organisation__ — Head over to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.trustshare.io)   to login and being creating your Organisation. You can provide your logo and your brand's   accent colour to customise the Checkout UI which is instantiated from the [Client SDK](/guides/client-sdk). 1. __Generate an API Key__ — Head to the developers section of the [dashboard](https://dashboard.trustshare.io/developers/api-keys)   and generate a new key pair. The _private key_ is used to interact with the trustshare API,   where-as the _public key_ is used to instantiate the [Client SDK](/guides/client-sdk).  # Environments The trustshare API has two environments, __Sandbox__ and __Live__. Both environments are available under the same endpoint however API Keys and client secrets are prefixed with the environment name. - A __Sandbox__ API Key will be in the format: `sandbox_api_[0-9a-z]`. - A __Live__ API Key will be in the format: `live_api_[0-9a-z]`.  ## Sandbox Our __Sandbox__ environment endeavours to be as close to the __Live__ environment as possible, however, there are a couple of limitations and features which should be noted. - Card payments take around 7 days to settle into accounts. In __Live__ this is generally closer to 2 days. - Manual inbound payments can only be \"faked\" in __Sandbox__ when they are less-than or equal-to `250,000.00`. - Open Banking in __Sandbox__ will always use a \"Mock Bank\" UI to accept the payment.  # Webhooks Payments are, by their very nature, asynchronous. As such methods of payment, including the receipt and release of funds can take an arbitrary amount of time to settle or execute. It is therefore advised to integrate with our _Webhook Events_ to be notified of changes to payments in real-time. For more information about our _Webhooks_, please visit our [Webhook Events](/guide/webhooks) guide.  # Authentication Every API call must include an `Authorization` header containing your API Key.
